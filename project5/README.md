# Project 5
## Michael Goodnow, Zackary Mackay

For this project we implimented steepest descent and tabu search for knapsack and graph coloring. Both of these algoritims can tend to get stuck on a solution that is close to the optimal one, for knapsack, however for graph coloring we observed that tabu increased in rate of new champion discovery as it got closer to optimal. Steepest descent was slower than greedy, but could find a more optimal solution when given the output of the
