# Project 5
## Michael Goodnow, Zackary Mackay

  For this project we implimented steepest descent and tabu search for knapsack and graph coloring. Both of these algoritims can tend to get stuck on a solution that is close to the optimal one, for knapsack, however for graph coloring we observed that tabu increased in rate of new champion discovery as it got closer to optimal. Steepest descent was slower than greedy, but could find a more optimal solution when given the output of that algorithim.
  The two algorithims we tested preformed more quickly and more optimally than the exhaustive algorithims. They were mixed in speed against the greedy algorithim, but could preform more optimally ultimately. They were both outpreformed by the ILP algorithims in both speed and optimallity. They both beat out the branch and bound algorithims in time and were worse in optimallity.
